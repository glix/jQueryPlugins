VERSION 1.4 12/19/2014
———————————————————————————
Version 1.4 is siq. We added transitions to the mask (finally!) so that it looks nice and pretty on open, and if you’re using a one page layout, looks just as slick. 

OH HEY! Also, it’s good to not repeat yourself, so we threw out some lines of code by defining the functions first, so it makes the code look a bit cleaner. I’m sure there’s more work to be done with that… 

VERSION 1.3+ Now lives on GitHub, no longer bitbucket.

VERSION 1.3 12/17/2014
———————————————————————————
Version 1.3 adds the ability to close the nav when clicking on the navigation link. The class is applied to the LI with a class of ‘nav-item’. 

VERSION 1.2 12/16/2014
———————————————————————————
Version 1.2 adds some new functionality and eye candy. We ditched font awesome for the ‘hamburger’ icon and use <span></span> to allow for an animation/transform into an X for closing the nav. This includes some big changes to the jQuery as well as a handful of CSS properties.

The jQuery now counts the clicks from the user on both the mask and the icon, to apply or remove the mask. 


VERSION 1.1 10/22/2014
———————————————————————————
Version 1.1 improves upon the initial 1.0 where all the nav did was push down the body, creates a mask that overlays the body to darken the content and detect clicks to close the nav.  (those were the days).
